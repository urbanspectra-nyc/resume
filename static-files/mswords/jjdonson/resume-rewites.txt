Custom Data Warehouse Architect, Developer & Administrator
JP Morgan / Chase Manhattan Bank: 2001 – 2003 / CitiBank, Inc: 1999 – 2001
Hired by CitiBank Marketing Division to audit massive batch processing by Acxiom, Inc.
Developed auditing scripts to verify, track and report errors changes in batch inputs and outputs.
This evolved quickly into an internal data hosting and reporting platform for own historical data.

Tasked by CitiBank Management to migrate historical data into new in-house Custom Time Series Data Warehouse.
This represented about ten years (2 Petabytes) of credit card demographics and financial banking data.

Within about six months, the following tasks were achieved: 
Validated all raw archived data in place during evening vendor maintenance windows. 
Devised flexible logical models and performant physical models to support ongoing time-series analytics. 
Set up a RedHat Linux Data Warehouse system with massively parallelized disk io, running Oracle 9i. 
Migrated all raw historical data to dedicated local Linux / Oracle Data Warehouse system. 
Developed PL/SQL Time-Series Warehouse REST API + Aggregation Schemes + CSV Export + Browser Tools. 
Validated Logical and Performance Requirements to the Satisfaction of Bank Management and Vendor. 
Automated daily data migrations, plus all daily, weekly/monthly/quarterly Data Warehouse Analytics reports. 
Trained many developers to create consistent and performant tools to leverage historical trends. Trained IT department staff to manage data warehouse validations, loads and scripts. 
Next I was sent to JP Morgan / Chase Manhattan Bank, another local Acxiom client, where I basically implemented the same in-house solutions listed above in their Data Processing department. These successful experiences using RedHat Linux for enterprise data process was my first step towards open source platforms and API’s.
