CHALLENGES
- Highly heterogenous (RHEL 5 Linux / Win2k8) hosted external LAN.
- Hard near term deadline for post-migration decommissions, else must sign another multi-million-dollar hosting contract.
- Multi-department and multi-vendor migration, while deployed apps changed constantly and BAU could not be disrupted.
- New LLT network was still being built out, and their world-class engineers had only begun to support this environment.
- Migration enhancements were pre-ordained and not tested.
- Development teams had no way to see their application logs in realtime during UAT and production deployments.
- Windows Server 2012 was required upgrade, and that OS version had a broken IP stack.  [Utter nightmare.]
- RHEL 5 => RHEL 6 was required upgrade, which was also causing some admin support concerns.
