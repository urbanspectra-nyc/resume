EMPLOYER:
- GooglePlay / RightsFlow, NYC

PROJECT:
GooglePlay had purchased this media rights management platform the prior year.
This was a hybrid deployment into:
- Google Cloud App Engine (python apps)
- Bare Metal Database Services
- Bare Metal Clustered Block and Object Storage

ROLE & TITLES HELD BY ME:
- Data Systems Architect & Engineer
- Hands-On Data Systems Testing Engineer
- Hands-On Technical Project Manager
- Dev Team Operations Support Engineer

DELIVERABLES:
- Migrate entire RightsFlow data center and applications into Google-managed infrastructure.
- Improve applications to support both python 2 and 3.  Deal with ongoing app changes from dev.
- Push a great deal of application logic to the database, to eliminate about 45% of python codebase.
- Get access to production hosts so that devs can assist during releases and deployments.

CHALLENGES
- All deliverables needed to comply with dev team and admin team Google support and security rules.
- Very technically challenging due to ongoing app code changes.
- Very politically difficult, because this company was used to having full control of their infrastructure.
- Database requirements included upgrading every DBMS to the current version.
- Database requirements included fixing many broken replication chains, and refactoring database schema models.
- Database requirements included making MySQL and Postgres as Oracle-Like as possible:
  - SQL-Mode = ‘Traditional’
  - Data Integrity Mode = ‘STRICT’
  - Exceptions to data integrity rules were handled with database automation.

ACHIEVEMENTS
- Migrated entire team code pipeline to jira and github.
- Trained both dev team and admin team in test-driven development using git for all code versioning.
- Migrated all data and apps to new infrastructure on time and at vastly better quality.
- Started to use docker containers for python 3 apps.
- Leveraged processing micro-services and security through google’s cloud service: appEngine
- Leveraged bare metal hosting for all database services.
- Ensured that there was no adverse impact to business-as-usual.
