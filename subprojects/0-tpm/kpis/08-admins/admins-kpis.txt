II. Admin Team KPI's.

COMMON ADMIN TEAM KPI CHALLENGE:  'Federated Secure, Flexible and Scalable Support Options'
Admins are to provide a flexible combination of full-service and self-serve support options.
This includes scalable security solutions that are do not interfere with getting work done, and are simple to manage.
They must support devs across all platforms and languages.

How does this impact the admin team and their ability to work effectively?
- Admin teams can become a bottleneck for those they support in several ways.
- Those who are able to self-serve become frustrated by their lack of autonomy.
- Instead of there being a security-first approach, including admin governance, LAN and WAN security becomes an afterthought, at best.

So, how to we confront the tendency for admins to omit quality security and support models?
- Devise team support models that offer both full-service and self-serve options.
- Require the admins to use the same systems that they use to support devs to build infrastructure tools.
- Give admins incentives to assist dev teams with their KPI's, so they can be attached to revenue.
- Support admin teams with a clear effort to prevent adverse impact to production operations, and promote early collaboration with devs.
