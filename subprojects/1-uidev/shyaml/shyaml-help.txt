Parses and output chosen subpart or values from YAML input.
It reads YAML in stdin and will output on stdout it's return value.

Usage:

    shyaml (-h|--help)
    shyaml ACTION KEY [DEFAULT]


Options:

    ACTION    Depending on the type of data you've targetted
              thanks to the KEY, ACTION can be:

              These ACTIONs applies to any YAML type:

                get-type          ## returns a short string
                get-value         ## returns YAML

              This ACTION applies to 'sequence' and 'struct' YAML type:

                get-values{,-0}   ## return list of YAML

              These ACTION applies to 'struct' YAML type:

                keys{,-0}         ## return list of YAML
                values{,-0}       ## return list of YAML
                key-values,{,-0}  ## return list of YAML

              Note that any value returned is returned on stdout, and
              when returning ``list of YAML``, it'll be separated by
              ``\n`` or ``NUL`` char depending of you've used the
              ``-0`` suffixed ACTION.

    KEY       Identifier to browse and target subvalues into YAML
              structure. Use ``.`` to parse a subvalue. If you need
              to use a literal ``.`` or ``\``, use ``\`` to quote it.

              Use struct keyword to browse ``struct`` YAML data and use
              integers to browse ``sequence`` YAML data.

    DEFAULT   if not provided and given KEY do not match any value in
              the provided YAML, then DEFAULT will be returned. If no
              default is provided and the KEY do not match any value
              in the provided YAML, shyaml will fail with an error 
              message.

Examples:

     ## get last grocery
     cat recipe.yaml       | shyaml get-value groceries.-1

     ## get all words of my french dictionary
     cat dictionaries.yaml | shyaml keys-0 french.dictionary

     ## get YAML config part of 'myhost'
     cat hosts_config.yaml | shyaml get-value cfgs.myhost
