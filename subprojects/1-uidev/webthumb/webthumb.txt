   WEBTHUMB(8) Linux System Manager's Manual WEBTHUMB(8)

   NAME

   webthumb -- web page snapshot-taker for Linux

   SYNOPSIS

   webthumb URL

   PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

   Take a snapshot of our home page and reduce it to a thumbnail no
   larger than 100x100, preserving the original aspect ratio (enter this
   command as one line, of course):

   webthumb http://www.boutell.com/ | pnmscale -xysize 100 100 |
   pnmtojpeg > thumb.jpg

   VERSION

   Version 1.01, 12/31/2003. Version 1.01 adds a simple locking mechanism
   that forces webthumb jobs to run in sequence so that each job receives
   the correct screenshot.

   REQUIREMENTS

   You must have the following tools, which are often already installed
   and/or available as packages for your Linux distribution:
     * The Xvfb virtual framebuffer X server. Sometimes not installed by
       default, but easily available as a package for Red Hat, Debian, et
       cetera.
     * The [1]Mozilla web browser.
     * The [2]netpbm image manipulation utilities. Almost always
       installed; it's easy to build them yourself or install them as a
       package.
     * The Linux operating system. webthumb uses the /proc file system to
       determine whether processes are still running properly.

   WHERE TO GET

   [3]Download from our web server.

   DESCRIPTION

   Creates a PPM-format image of the first screenful of a web page and
   writes this image to standard output. This is done using the Xvfb
   virtual framebuffer X server, which provides an environment for the
   mozilla web browser. To minimize CPU impact, the Xvfb and mozilla
   processes are kept resident in memory and reused by future invocations
   of webthumb. See the top of the Perl source for useful settings.

   BUGS

   The "chrome" of the browser is displayed. This could be fixed with a
   set of custom XUL files and the -chrome command line option. If you
   have run Mozilla or Netscape 4 interactively as the current Unix user
   before, Mozilla may display dialog boxes telling you about profile
   upgrades and so forth, which prevent the display of the desired page.
   This can be addressed by deleting the .mozilla and .netscape folders
   from the home directory of the current Unix user, if they do not
   contain files that are important to you. It would be nice if webthumb
   could set up your Mozilla preferences at first use in an appropriate
   way.

   In an ideal world, mozilla would have a command line option like this:

   mozilla -htmltops URL (THIS DOESN'T REALLY EXIST)

   In order to produce a high-quality postscript version of a web page
   without the need for any X server at all, and this could then be piped
   through ghostscript to produce all manner of great things. But there
   is no such feature, so webthumb is a handy workaround.
