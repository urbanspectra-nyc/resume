### Topology

Topologies are graphical representations of relationships between entities such
as VMs, Hosts, Networks, Container, Providers and more.

Each type of topology has it's own controller derived from
`TopologyController`. To calculate the topology data such controller uses a
class derived from `TopologyService`.
