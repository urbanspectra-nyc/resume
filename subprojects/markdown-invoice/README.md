# Markdown Invoice

This is a simple Symfony console application that I use to turn Markdown invoices into HTML or PDF.


## Setup

Simply create your invoice folders under `invoices/` directory. Example: `paid`, `unpaid`, `estimates`. A recommended file 
naming format is `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[project].md` (2013-01-15-github.md).

See `invoices/2013-01-15-sample.md` for an example Markdown invoice. The script uses a template `invoices/layout.html` to give the invoice its layout and styling which you can modify to your needs.

## Useage

```bash
bin/markdown-invoice generate --help
Usage:
 generate [--output[="..."]] src [invoice]

Arguments:
 src                   Location of invoice; ex: "paid", "unpaid"
 invoice               What invoice to generate for?

Options:
 --output              Output to format; html or pdf (default: "html")
 --help (-h)           Display this help message.
 --quiet (-q)          Do not output any message.
 --verbose (-v)        Increase verbosity of messages.
 --version (-V)        Display this application version.
 --ansi                Force ANSI output.
 --no-ansi             Disable ANSI output.
 --no-interaction (-n) Do not ask any interactive question.
```

Example run:

```bash
bin/markdown-invoice generate unpaid --output=pdf
Please choose an invoice in "unpaid"...

1. 2012-01-15-xxxx.md
2. 2012-01-14-xxx.md
Which invoice? 2

Generating for invoice "2012-01-14-xxx"...

Invoice generated.
PDF saved to: output/2012-01-14-xxx.pdf
```
