### Simple UI plugins

The UI has a very simple mechanism for plugging in menu sections and items.

There are a number of limitations:

 * Only top level sections can be plugged (not second level)
 * From the plugged in item/section you can either open an existing URL in the application or an external URL.
 * The external URL will be opened in an iframe.
