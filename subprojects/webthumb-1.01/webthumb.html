<p>
webthumb -- web page snapshot-taker for Linux
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">SYNOPSIS</font>
<p>
<code>webthumb URL</code>
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">PRACTICAL EXAMPLE</font>
<p>
Take a snapshot of our home page and reduce it to a thumbnail no larger
than 100x100, preserving the original aspect ratio (enter this
command as one line, of course):
<p>
<code>webthumb http://www.boutell.com/ | pnmscale -xysize 100 100 | pnmtojpeg > thumb.jpg</code>
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">VERSION</font>
<p>
Version 1.01, 12/31/2003. Version 1.01 adds a simple locking mechanism 
that forces webthumb jobs to run in sequence so that each job receives 
the correct screenshot.
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">REQUIREMENTS</font>
<p>
You must have the following tools, which are often already
installed and/or available as packages for your Linux distribution: 
<ul>
<li>The <b>Xvfb</b> virtual framebuffer X server. Sometimes not installed
by default, but easily available as a package for Red Hat, Debian, et cetera.
<li>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> web browser. 
<li>The <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">netpbm</a> image
manipulation utilities. Almost always installed; it's easy to build them
yourself or install them as a package.  
<li>The <b>Linux</b> operating system. webthumb uses the /proc file system
to determine whether processes are still running properly.
</ul>

<font color="#FF8888" size="4">DESCRIPTION</font>
<p>
Creates a PPM-format image of the first screenful of a web page and
writes this image to standard output. This is done using the Xvfb
virtual framebuffer X server, which provides an environment for the
mozilla web browser. To minimize CPU impact, the Xvfb and mozilla
processes are kept resident in memory and reused by future
invocations of <code>webthumb</code>. See the top of the Perl
source for useful settings.
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">BUGS</font>
<p>
The "chrome" of the browser is displayed. This could be fixed with a
set of custom XUL files and the -chrome command line option. If you have
run Mozilla or Netscape 4 interactively as the current Unix user before,
Mozilla may display dialog boxes telling you about profile upgrades and
so forth, which prevent the display of the desired page. This can be
addressed by deleting the .mozilla and .netscape folders from the
home directory of the current Unix user, <b>if they do not contain
files that are important to you.</b> It would be nice if webthumb
could set up your Mozilla preferences at first use in an appropriate way.
<p>
In an ideal world, mozilla would have a command line option like this:
<p>
<code>mozilla -htmltops URL (THIS DOESN'T REALLY EXIST)</code>
<p>
In order to produce a high-quality postscript version of a web page
without the need for any X server at all, and this could then be
piped through ghostscript to produce all manner of great things. But
there is no such feature, so webthumb is a handy workaround.
