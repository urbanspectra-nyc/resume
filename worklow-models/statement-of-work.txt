Name: Typical Subjects Of Statement of Work (SOW)
- Purpose: Why are we doing this project? A purpose statement attempts to answer this.
- Scope of Work: This describes the work to be done and specifies the hardware and software involved.
- Location of Work: This describes where the work is to be performed, including the location of hardware and software and where people will meet to do the work.
- Period of Performance: This specifies the allowable time for projects, such as start and finish time, number of hours that can be billed per week or month, where work is to be performed and anything else that relates to scheduling.
- Deliverables Schedule: This part lists and describes what is due and when.
- Applicable Standards: This describes any industry specific standards that need to be adhered to in fulfilling the contract.
- Acceptance Criteria: This specifies how the buyer or receiver of goods will determine if the product or service is acceptable, usually with objective criteria. See Acceptance testing.
- Special Requirements: This specifies any special hardware or software, specialized workforce requirements, such as degrees or certifications for personnel, travel requirements, and anything else not covered in the contract specifics.
- Type of Contract/Payment Schedule: The project acceptance will depend on if the budget available will be enough to cover the work required. Therefore a breakdown of payments by whether they are up-front or phased will usually be negotiated in an early stage.
- Miscellaneous: Many items that are not part of the main negotiations may be listed because they are important to the project, and overlooking or forgetting them could pose problems for the project.
