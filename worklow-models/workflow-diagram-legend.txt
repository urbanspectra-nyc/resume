Name: Thumboot Create + Enhance
- Sketch vlan plan for vagrant from thumboot.
- Sketch thumboot proposed contents.
- Gather thumboot local iso resources to url.
- Gather thumboot tools to interconvert iso: qcow, ovf, ami, etc.
- Test each os, install local tools, derive vms.
- NOTE: Each vm must be deployed ready to use, except for user registration and conifgs.
- Secure thumboot with shared admin password that will expire and shift.
- Move thumboot iso and vm contents to https vlan service.
- Test PXE Boot For Network Provisioning
- Give vagrant new vlan repository, to support
